# Simple Cache Sim

A simplified cache simulator for instructional purposes.

This can be compiled using:

```bash
g++ cache_sim.cpp -O3 --std=c++2a -o cache_sim
```

Note, this uses C++17 and C++20 features, so you will likely need g++-10 or later (or you will need to make some slight modifications to the source code).
